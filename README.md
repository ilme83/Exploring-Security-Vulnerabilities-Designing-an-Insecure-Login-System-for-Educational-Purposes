# Exploring-Security-Vulnerabilities-Designing-an-Insecure-Login-System-for-Educational-Purposes
The objective of this project is to create a login system with a specific vulnerability: it checks whether the username and password exist in the database but does not verify if they correspond to the same user. While retaining this flaw as a demonstration, we also implement additional measures to prevent other vulnerabilities, making the system secure in other aspects.
